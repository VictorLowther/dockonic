This is a stupid wrapper around Docker for running
Ironic tests and quick dev work.  To run it, run

    ./dockonic /path/to/openstack/repos

where /path-to-openstack-repos is where your ironic and
python-ironicclient repos live.

It is currently noptimized, and sets up a new
container from scratch each time it is run.  However,
it bind-mounts your source in the container, so you do not
have to kill and restart the container every time you make a change.
